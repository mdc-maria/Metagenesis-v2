    <p>The creation of a narrative that subverts the boundaries between fact and fiction implied a process materialised through an editorial object to archive all the information behind the development of Metagenesis. The Codex is divided into four installments.</p>

    <p1>The transformations of the universe have always seemed an abstract event, sometimes still without explanation; we can almost associate them with magic tricks on a completely dark stage, which cause temporal hiatuses where metamorphic processes move galactic, stellar and planetary layers. Such mergers provoked, millions of years ago, an explosion of life, where the first multicellular organisms of nature began to multiply but that, through, again, spatial mutations, were driven to their extinction. 
    <br><br>
   Repeating this vicious cycle of constant transformations, emerges a species that, millions of years later, would come to dominate the planet we inhabit, becoming a tireless force upon the earth and off cataloguing the natural world and its society as it unfolds. Assuming itself as a pole of constant creation, in the sense that every individual descends from a single cell, the human being is now face to face with the possibility of the emergence of a new cellular entity, which could be an indication for a confrontation between the human and a being beyond humanityâ€”a metahuman. These transformative possibilities announce a challenge to the overcoming of Man over Nature, the power of humanity to redesign its own species. By questioning the present biological ideals, the premise inherent to the creation of this new entity projects mankind in a new evolutionary dimension.
    <br><br>
  In this chain of ideas, in an alternative reality, it is suggested, then, the possibility of the birth of a new entity that announces a new history of social, political and cultural conditions that go beyond the biological conditions inherent to the human being. Detaching itself from the canonical ideal of conception, and subverting the process of morphogenesis, this new being comes, then, to challenge the biological factors in question, which, in turn, will question the limits of biology, since there will be, notoriously, a reconfiguration of their own and collective identity, as well as the social structures in which these new entities emerge.
    <br><br>
 Far from the unity of the first cell, the organic identity of the human and its original ancestry, the subversion of the morphogenesis process proposes the creation of abstract sexes and new bodies. Moving away from the idea of perpetuating the sex and gender binarism, the possibility of this subversion exhibits potential for unfolding a continuous variation of body and sex, nature and matter.</p1>
