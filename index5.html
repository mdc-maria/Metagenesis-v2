    <p>Biology can reconfigure society and human behavior through the subversion of biological processes that are capable of decentering the human being from the social structures previously built to its measure. In that way, each of us developed individual perspectives on different dimensions of the fiction. Our approach was not to take detours from the main narrative, but instead to add layers of significance and expand subjects we found worthy of expansion: science and knowledge, religion, relationships, and culture.</p>

    <p2> An introduction on the new self-being<br>by duarte costa</p2>
    <p1>Human evolution and the various transformations associated with it have been part of the constant mergers through which the universe has passed. As a result of these changes, where countless multicellular organisms began to multiply, a species emerged—the human being,—that, millions of years later, would come to dominate the Earth, assuming itself as a tireless force that catalogs society through its dominant character. 
    <br><br>
    Associated with the prevalence of Man, intellectual movements emerged, such as the Enlightenment or Humanism, which served science and knowledge and placed him as the center of the Universe—all data, studies, and standards present in today’s society are based on the study of Man.
    <br><br>
    In <i>An Introduction on The New Self-Being</i>, the birth of a new entity is suggested, the result of the conception between sexed and asexual bodies, which will question the dominance of Man, thus forcing his decentralization from the center of the universe. Knowledge and science will then be reconfigured through the delinking of the metahuman being from gender and fixed biological sex. All the ideals of society, which are based on knowledge and science around Man, will be reformulated, as will the social structures in which these new entities arise.</p1>
